## Quotes App

This quotes app reads a "recentquotes.json" file located in the resources folder (`quotes/app/src/main/resources`) and prints out a random quote and the author's name. Alternatively the app can be run with arguments to search for a random quote of a specific author or by a quote that contains the searched text. Currently text is case sensitive.
